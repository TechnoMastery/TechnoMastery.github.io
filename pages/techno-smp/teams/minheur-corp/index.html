            <h3>When benny left</h3>
            <p>Benny decided to leave the Minheur' Corp on our Minecraft serveur, the TechnoSMP, on July the first, 2025.</p>
            <p>He announced he wanted to stop, so he quited the discord server, marking the end of his acces to the Minecraft server.</p>
            <p>This set appart, he will be autorized to come back playing with us at any moment, if he wants to.</p>
            <p>Benny, the Minheur' Corp will always open their doors for you.</p>
            <p>Benny didn't said lots on why he left : he just said "I stop". I don't think he left because he don't want to play with us anymore, I think he just want to stop playing.</p>
